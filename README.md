To run our code, first run the cells to load the libraries and model at the top.

For Task 3, run the cells in the regression task block.

For Task 5, run the cells in the classification task block. The first block will load the dataset and setup the tokenizer. Block 2 tests the tokenizer to ensure proper running. The remaining blocks are marked for training and evaluation. We encountered issues with torch and cuda on Great Lakes, so we ran with very high memory on largemem to get our results. Results should be the same as if we used GPU.
